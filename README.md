#EV Battery Failure Prediction

##Project Description

This project aims to assess the safety risks and predict failures of electric vehicle (EV) batteries. The rapid development of EVs in recent years has led to an increased need for reliable battery failure prediction systems to ensure the safety of drivers and passengers. This project uses data based on the GB/T 32960-2016 standard to train a predictive model for battery failure.

##Data

The data used in this project is collected from 10 EVs of a certain brand over a period of 6 months. The data collection fields are based on the requirements of the GB/T 32960 standard. For detailed field information, please download the attachment from the official competition website's innovation group topic two page.

##Methodology

The project follows these steps:

###Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the raw data, including handling missing values, outliers, and potential noise.
###Feature Engineering: Extracting useful features from the preprocessed data, including the battery's charging status, driving status, idle status, etc.
###Model Selection and Training: Choosing and training suitable machine learning models based on the characteristics of the problem and the data.
###Model Validation and Tuning: Validating and tuning the trained models using techniques like cross-validation and grid search.
###Failure Warning: Using the trained and validated models to predict battery failures and issue warnings when potential failures are detected.
###Result Analysis and Reporting: Analyzing and reporting the results, including explaining how the models work and their performance in predicting battery failures.

##How to Run

To run the code in this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file.
Run the scripts in the src directory in the order they are numbered.
The trained models will be saved in the models directory, and the prediction results will be saved in the results directory.
